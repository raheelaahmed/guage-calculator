# Guage Calculator:

Guage calculator is a tool used by the people who crochet or knit. They use it to calculate the number rows and number of Stiches per inch, so they can used it for their project, it helps them to calculate how many rows they will be needing for specific length and how many stitches for specific width.
To calculate the guage you have to do the following steps:

* Make a swatch(sample) using your desired staich that you want to use for your project.
* Measure the length and width of the swatch.
* Count the number of rows.
* Count the number of stitches in a row.

You will need above measurements to calculate your guage for the project. 
It is very important to use same hook size and yarn for the project taht you used for swatch.

## Story:
 If you crochet you can understand the importance of calculation for your project. By making less or more stiches whole project goes out of the place. If you do the calculations 
 manually there are chances of human error.
 When i was doing my first crochet jumper by following a pattern. It was a crochet hooded cardigan for the baby(6 month old).
 I did not used the right guage for the pattern and when the project was complete it was measuring a newborn size. so guage and hook size is very important.
 when i got the chance to make a python project. I wanted to make a calculator for my fellow crocheters.

 ## Crochet Guage Calculator:

This calculator can calculate the following for you:

* It can Calculate Guage for you, number of rows and stiches per inch.
* It can calculate for you how many Rows and how many Stitches per row you need for the project according to your desired length and width of the project.
* It can calculate how many grams of yarn/wool you will be needing for the project.
* It can calculate the cost of the project for you.


 




This is the Code Institute student template for deploying your third portfolio project, the Python command-line project. The last update to this file was: **May 14, 2024**

## Reminders

- Your code must be placed in the `run.py` file
- Your dependencies must be placed in the `requirements.txt` file
- Do not edit any of the other files or your code may not deploy properly

## Creating the Heroku app

When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:

1. `heroku/python`
2. `heroku/nodejs`

You must then create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`

If you have credentials, such as in the Love Sandwiches project, you must create another _Config Var_ called `CREDS` and paste the JSON into the value field.

Connect your GitHub repository and deploy as normal.

## Constraints

The deployment terminal is set to 80 columns by 24 rows. That means that each line of text needs to be 80 characters or less otherwise it will be wrapped onto a second line.

Happy coding!
